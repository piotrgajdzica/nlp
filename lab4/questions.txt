Which measure works better for the problem?
Log likelihood ratio, becaouse:
	- pmi doesn't consider the fact that some words are very infrequent
	- pmi assumes normal distribution of words
What would be needed, besides good measure, to build a dictionary of multiword expressions?
	- big set of data
	- taking context under consideration
	- high quality data (depends on target usage)
Can you identify a certain threshold which clearly divides the good expressions from the bad?
